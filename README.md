# Scrummy Bot
Scrummy Bot is a discord bot programmed using node.js and discord.js and backed by a MongoDB database. It can be used by software engineering
and game design teams to track and encourage the following:
- Clocking in and out to track time worked
- Remembering daily standup meeting commitments
- Remembering sprint deadlines and reporting individual, per-sprint efforts
- Generating reports of all of the above

## Why Did We Create This?
This bot was created with the Game Design and Development capstone experience at UW Stout in mind. Teams of about 12 students (split evenly
into programmers and artists) work for a full year to create a 3d game in a popular game engine. The courses attempt to use Agile design
techniques and software engineering practices and encourage scrum team management.

Discord has been the platform of choice of these teams for to communicate, especially during the 2020 - 2021 coronavirus pandemic where
much instruction was done 100% remotely. We decided to implement a solution to track these important metrics in Discord to meet the team
where they were already working and to also incorporate gentle reminders for them in their daily work.

## Work In Progress
This tool is work-in-progress, continually evolving and developing to meet the needs of the active capstone teams using it. Feel free to
file issues as bug reports and feature requests but know that requests from current capstone students may be prioritized.
